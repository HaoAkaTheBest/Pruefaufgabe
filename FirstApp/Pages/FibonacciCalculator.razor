<h3>Fibonacci Calculator</h3>

<p>
    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms.<br />
    By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...<br />
    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million,
    find the sum of the even-valued terms.
